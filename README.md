# Solar Position Viewer

This project visualizes the current position of the sun and the day/night terminator on an interactive map using [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. For best results when testing locally, serve the files with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

The map will update automatically every second to show the sun's location and the changing day/night boundary.

## Hosting

This site is designed to work with GitHub Pages. Simply push the code to a repository's `main` or `gh-pages` branch and enable Pages in your repository settings.
